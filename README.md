# Mad City RPG application

Mad City is a tabletop RPG game.

I am developing the mechanics and building an app to help the players.

Building the app also helps me think through the mechanics and how things should work.

I am starting with a simple PHP and jQuery during the prototype phase. I will be transitioning to React once I know how I want the mechanics / application to operate.

I will also be setting this up as a PWA so that it can be played without an internet connection and loaded from the home screen.


**Development Path:**

### Phase 1 - Initial Development and Planning
Character Display

Basic Styling

Character Saving 

Develop and Test Mechanics (Current Phase)

User Login

Multiple Character Creation per User / Character Switching

### Phase 2 - React Conversion
Convert to React

POSSIBLY convert to Firebase for database.

? Connect with Google / Facebook ?

### Phase 3 - PWA

Setup PWA: Service Workers, Local Storage, Working with No internet, Syncing with database when connection returns.
	
### Phase 4 - Polish
Add features and spend more time on styling.

Roll mechanic to allow users to make any roll by clicking an icon next to that stat/skill/power

Add Documentation from Google Drive Sheets
